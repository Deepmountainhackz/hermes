# Hermes - Global Systems Intelligence Platform

A modular data intelligence system that unifies financial, environmental, social, and demographic data into one transparent framework.

## Overview

Hermes is designed to surface actionable signals, track long-term structural trends, and visualize real-time disruptions across global systems.

## Current Features

### Market Data Layer âœ…
- Automated fetching of stock market data (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
- Daily price tracking (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- CSV export for historical analysis
- Error handling and rate limit management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Alpha Vantage API key (free at https://www.alphavantage.co)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepmountainHackz/hermes.git
cd hermes
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests pandas python-dotenv
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API key:
```
ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY=your_key_here
```

4. Run the market data fetcher:
```bash
python fetch_market_data.py
```

## Project Architecture
```
hermes/
â”œâ”€â”€ fetch_market_data.py    # Market data ingestion
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                     # API keys (not committed)
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore              # Security configuration
â””â”€â”€ data_*.csv              # Generated data files
```
